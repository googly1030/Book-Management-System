Project Description
This repository contains the source code and assets for a book management system developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to add and display books dynamically using a popup interface.

Deletion: Each book container includes a delete button that allows users to remove unwanted books.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Markup language for structuring the project.
CSS: Stylesheets for visual presentation and layout.
JavaScript: Used for interactivity, such as displaying/hiding the book popup and dynamically managing book containers.

Project Layout:
style.css: Contains the styling rules for the entire project, managing the appearance of elements and containers.
script.js: Houses the JavaScript logic to control the popup display, book addition, and deletion functionalities.
index.html: The main HTML file, representing the project's structure and integrating styles and scripts.
